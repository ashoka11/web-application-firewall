# web-application-firewall

Creating a README.md file is a useful way to document your project and provide instructions for users. Below is a template for a README.md file tailored for a simple web application firewall (WAF) project that protects against common web application attacks like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Simple Web Application Firewall (WAF)
This project implements a basic web application firewall (WAF) using Python and Flask to filter and monitor incoming HTTP requests for common web application attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

Features
	* SQL Injection Protection: Detects and blocks HTTP requests with potential SQL injection patterns in query parameters or form data.
	* XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention: Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks by escaping potentially dangerous characters in output.

Prerequisites
	* Python 3.x installed on your machine.
	* Familiarity with Flask web framework.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ashoka__11/web-application-firewallgit

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd web-application-firewall

3. Install dependencies (Flask):
pip install flask

usage

1. Start the Flask application:
python app.py

2. Access the application in your web browser:
http://localhost:5000/

3. Submit HTTP requests to the application with query parameters or form data.

Configuration
	* Customize the firewall rules (e.g., add more regex patterns) in app.py according to your specific security requirements.

Examples

SQL Injection Example

1. Access the application in your web browser:
http://localhost:5000/?name=admin' OR '1'='1' --

2. The firewall will detect the SQL injection attempt and block the request with a 403 Forbidden response.

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Example

1. Submit a form with a script tag:

<form action="/" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="message" value="<script>alert('XSS');</script>">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

2. The firewall will sanitize the input to prevent script execution before processing the request.
